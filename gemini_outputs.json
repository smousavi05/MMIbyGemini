Noticed by persons driving motor cars.) and MMI VIII (Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse; great in poorly built structures. Panel walls thrown out of frame structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned. Sand and mud ejected in small amounts. Changes in well water. Disturbed persons driving motor cars.). While there's no visible structural damage in the video, the intensity and duration of the shaking, the movement of heavy objects, and the human and animal reactions suggest an intensity closer to the higher end of this range (MMI VIII)."
